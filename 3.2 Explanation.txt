The reason for this phenomenon in my opinion is because of a couple factors.  The first update is finding the path to the data base and from the web page, this takes time. Once this has been estabilished this connection is kept alive and it much quicker to happen.  Also the server and the database both probably use some form of caching in the background and with that, finding the initial entry can take some time, but once you have the first one, kind of like the connection it can search within that visinicty for its correct path/location and find and update things much quicker.
